A tool for real time plagiarism detection on homework helper sites like Chegg and CourseHero

## Motivation 

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most schools are planning to move to remote learning for the foreseeable future, 
which brings its own set of challenges. A very prominent challenge is the increased incidences of plagiarism 
and other university/school honor code violations. To battle this, we have developed an application that allows the teaching 
staff to monitor commonly known websites that host homework/test solutions such as Chegg & Coursehero real-time 
for posts asking for solutions to their unique questions. This will relieve the staff from the burden of having to manually search for these posts -- an arduous undertaking. It would be particularly helpful to teachers from schools that are unable to allocate sufficient resources or time to tackle the increase in the number of plagiarism incidents.
